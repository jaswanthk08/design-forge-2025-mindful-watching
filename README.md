## 🎯 Concept Overview

FlowPause is a subtle redesign of YouTube’s mobile experience aimed at reducing compulsive binge-watching — without harming engagement. The idea is to use gentle UI nudges instead of forceful interruptions.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🌥️ **Break Modal:** A calming overlay lets users choose to pause or continue with no judgment.
