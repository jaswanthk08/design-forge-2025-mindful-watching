## 🎯 Concept Overview

FlowPause is a subtle redesign of YouTube’s mobile experience aimed at reducing compulsive binge-watching — without harming engagement. The idea is to use gentle UI nudges instead of forceful interruptions.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧘‍♂️ **Soft Session Reminder:** After 20 mins of watch time, a light pulse appears on the screen with a mindful message.
- 🌥️ **Break Modal:** A calming overlay lets users choose to pause or continue with no judgment.
- 🛠️ **Mindful Mode Toggle:** Found in settings, this lets users enable or disable visual mindfulness cues.
